# Linked List Submission
This project was a wonderful introduction to data-structures. The key was to abuse the `at()` and `size()` functions for cleaner code, such as with `insert_at` and `remove_at()`.

Being able to call `#next_node` with `at()` was also a great way to showcase how cool objects can be.
